Dear Employees,

We would like to inform you that on April 24 at 10 AM PST, we will be installing Adobe CC All Apps Suite on your laptops. This installation is necessary to ensure that we have the latest software tools to support our work and provide you with the necessary resources to be productive.

The installation process will take approximately 30 minutes to an hour, depending on your internet connection speed. During this time, you will not be able to use your laptop, so please make sure to save any important work before the installation begins.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to our support team. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding as we work to improve our systems and resources.

Thank you!
